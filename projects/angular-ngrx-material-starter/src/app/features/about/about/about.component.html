        <h2>About PMIS</h2>
          <p>PMIS is a sytematic approach for gathering data or information regarding the 
            Budget Execution Documents (BEDs) which contain the agency plans, spending schedules
            and physical targets for evaluation and consolidation. It is a tool in keeping up-dated 
            records on the present accomplishment status of financial, physical and disbursement of the 
            department/agency/OUs. This data/records is then processed, integrated, and stored in 
            the centralized database and made available to all who have authority to access it,
            in a form that suits the department's purpose. This will be the basis for measuring the 
            agency's performance.
